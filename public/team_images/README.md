# Team Images

This folder contains images of team members for the DT&I EEE A website.

## Image Naming Convention

Images now follow this naming pattern:
- Roll number based: `23KD1A0201.jpg`, `24KD5A0203.jpg`, etc.

This naming convention directly uses the student's roll number as the filename, making it easier to identify and update images.

## Placeholder Images

The current images in this folder are placeholders. Please replace them with actual images of team members while maintaining the same naming convention.

## Image Specifications

For best results:
- Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Recommended resolution: 400x400 pixels
- Keep file sizes reasonable (100-300KB)
- Use JPG or PNG formats
